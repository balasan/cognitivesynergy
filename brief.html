The collected algorithms of the artist will be ultimately compiled as data to form a higher construct of navigation and reveal management for the self who exists dually in a natural / un-natural (computational) realm.<br /><br /> By analyzing the self I attempt to examine and solve the problems within my own particular human revolution, building one thought at time a structure that creates a cognitive synergy.<br /><br /> Please follow / interact on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/existingself" target="_blank">@ExistingSelf</a> <img style="line-height:2px" src="http://www.employtouch.com/img/twitter_bird.png"></p>
